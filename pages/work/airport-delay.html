      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Airport Delay Performance Analytics was developed to address the challenge of understanding and comparing flight delay behavior across U.S.
        airports and airlines using operational data. Flight delays impact passengers, airlines, and airport operations, yet delay patterns are often 
        buried in fragmented reports and averages that mask variability. The goal of this project is to provide a clear, consolidated view of delay performance 
        that supports benchmarking, monitoring, and high-level assessment of operational reliability across airports and carriers.
      </p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>
  The project uses structured flight delay data to analyze performance across airports and airlines over time.
   Key delay metrics were aggregated and segmented by delay type to enable comparison and trend analysis. Interactive 
   visualizations were built in Tableau using calculated fields, time-series views, and benchmarking logic, allowing users 
   to explore delay behavior, compare performance across entities, and monitor changes through dynamic filters.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
  The analysis revealed meaningful variation in delay performance across airports and airlines, with clear differences in both magnitude and consistency over time.
   Time-series views highlighted periods of elevated delay and variability, while benchmarking enabled identification of underperforming and above-average performers.
    Breaking delays down by type provided additional context on whether issues were driven by operational factors, weather, or downstream aircraft availability, supporting
     more informed performance assessment.
