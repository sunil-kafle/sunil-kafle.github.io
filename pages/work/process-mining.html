  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Sepsis is a time-critical medical condition where delays in diagnosis and treatment can significantly affect 
    patient outcomes. Hospitals generate detailed event logs capturing clinical activities, lab tests, and
     decision points throughout a patient’s care journey. This project analyzes a real hospital sepsis event 
     log to better understand patient flow, treatment timelines, and operational bottlenecks in emergency care pathways.
  </p>

  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>
    The project uses process mining techniques to analyze an event log published by Eindhoven University 
    of Technology (TU/e). The data were loaded and parsed using PM4Py, then converted into a pandas DataFrame 
    for analysis. Events were sorted by patient case and timestamp to reconstruct patient journeys. Cycle time
     metrics were computed at both case and activity levels, and process maps were generated to visualize care
      pathways and identify delays across clinical activities and lab results.
  </p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    The analysis revealed significant variation in patient cycle times, highlighting potential 
    delays in diagnostic testing and clinical decision points. Process maps and performance metrics
     helped identify bottlenecks in the workflow, particularly around lab result availability and 
     treatment transitions. These insights demonstrate how process mining can support operational 
     improvement in healthcare settings by making complex clinical workflows transparent and measurable.
