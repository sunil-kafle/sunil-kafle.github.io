This project analyzes state-level sales performance across the United States to 
support data-driven decision-making. Using interactive visual analytics, the dashboard
 highlights geographic patterns, regional concentration, and relative performance 
 across states. The final output enables stakeholders to quickly identify
  high-performing regions, assess regional contribution, and explore sales 
  distribution through intuitive, map-based views.      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project analyzes regional and state-level sales performance for a multi-region organization operating across the United States.
         Stakeholders needed a clear way to compare sales, profit, and margin across regions while identifying geographic concentration and 
         performance trends over time. The resulting Tableau dashboard consolidates sales, profit, and category-level data into an interactive 
         visual analytics tool that supports regional performance monitoring and strategic decision-making.
      </p>

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The dashboard was developed in Tableau using aggregated sales and profit data from 2018 to 2020. 
        Multiple views were designed to support different analytical questions, including time-series analysis, 
        regional comparison, category-level profitability, and geographic distribution. Calculated fields and table
         calculations were used to compute profit margin, percent change in sales, and performance thresholds. Interactive 
         filters allowed users to explore performance by region and sales volume dynamically.
         <p>
  Key components included:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Time-series analysis of total sales and month-over-month change</li>
  <li>Regional and channel-level sales breakdown</li>
  <li>Sales vs. profit analysis by product category</li>
  <li>State-level sales distribution using geographic mapping</li>
  <li>Threshold-based highlighting for performance monitoring</li>
</ul>

      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>

</div>



      <p>
      The dashboard revealed clear regional differences in sales and profitability, with strong concentration in a subset of states. 
      Time-series analysis highlighted seasonal patterns and periods of volatility, while category-level views showed a strong relationship
       between sales volume and profit generation. The geographic map enabled rapid identification of high-performing and underperforming states,
        improving interpretability compared to tabular reports and supporting faster, insight-driven evaluation.
