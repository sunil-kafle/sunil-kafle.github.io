  <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
        I am a data scientist with a cross-disciplinary background spanning agribusiness,
        economics, and applied data science. My work focuses on using data to support sound
        decision-making in real organizational settings—particularly where data is imperfect,
        constrained, or collected for purposes other than analytics. I am interested in problems
        where analytical rigor must be balanced with operational realities, institutional context,
        and downstream impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        My early professional work was grounded in agribusiness and nonprofit program environments,
        where I was responsible for survey design, data collection, monitoring, and reporting for
        donor-funded and operational projects. In these roles, I worked extensively with statistical
        and data management tools such as Stata, SPSS, Access, Excel, and survey platforms like
        Qualtrics to manage datasets, analyze outcomes, and communicate findings to diverse
        stakeholders. This experience shaped how I approach data today: with attention to data
        quality, definition consistency, and the practical needs of decision-makers.
      </p>

      <p>
        As analytical problems grew in scope and complexity, my work expanded toward more
        reproducible and programmatic workflows. I formalized this work through data science,
        combining statistical modeling, machine learning, and database-driven analysis to build
        end-to-end analytical systems rather than isolated analyses. My projects span consumer
        finance, healthcare operations, and business performance data, including natural language
        processing for complaint classification, predictive modeling for risk and default analysis,
        customer segmentation, time-series forecasting, and process mining of healthcare event logs
        to study workflows, cycle times, and operational bottlenecks.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am completing a Master of Science in Data Science and have formal training across applied
        machine learning, databases, GIS, data engineering, and analytics ethics. I value rigor,
        transparency, and reproducibility, and I approach data work with an awareness of how
        analytical choices affect people, organizations, and systems. I am particularly interested
        in business-focused roles across healthcare, regulated industries, public-sector, or
        nonprofit contexts—settings where data is used not just to scale systems, but to improve
        the quality, defensibility, and impact of decisions.
