  <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
        I am a data scientist with a cross-disciplinary background spanning agribusiness,
        economics, and applied data science. My work focuses on using data to support sound
        decision-making in real organizational settings—particularly where data is imperfect,
        constrained, or collected for purposes other than analytics. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My early professional work was rooted in agribusiness and nonprofit program settings, where I led survey design, 
        data collection, monitoring, and reporting for donor-funded and operational projects. I worked extensively with 
        tools such as Stata, SPSS, Access, Excel, and survey platforms like Qualtrics to manage datasets, analyze outcomes, 
        and communicate findings to diverse stakeholders. This experience shaped how I approach data today, with a strong emphasis 
        on data quality, consistent definitions, and the practical needs of decision-makers.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am completing a Master of Science in Data Science with formal training in applied machine learning, databases, GIS, data engineering, and analytics ethics.
        I value rigor, transparency, and reproducibility, and I approach data work with an awareness of how analytical choices shape people, organizations, and systems.
        I am interested in roles where data is applied thoughtfully to support sound analysis, improve process, and support decision-making across real-world settings.      </p>

       <p>
        As analytical problems increased in scope and complexity, my work increasingly emphasized reproducible and programmatic workflows. I formalized this work through data science,
        combining statistical modeling, machine learning, and database-driven analysis to build end-to-end analytical systems. My projects span consumer
        finance, healthcare operations, data engineering, and business performance data, including
